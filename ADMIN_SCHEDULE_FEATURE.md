# Admin Course Scheduling Feature

## Overview

The admin course scheduling feature allows administrators to drag and drop courses onto a weekly schedule, making them available for student enrollment. This feature provides a visual interface for managing course schedules and ensures that scheduled courses are automatically made available for enrollment.

- **Weekly Schedule Grid**: Visual representation of the week with time slots
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag courses from the unscheduled panel to any time slot

### 2. Schedule Management
- **Time Slots**: Predefined time slots throughout the day (8:00-9:30, 9:40-11:10, etc.)
- **Room Assignment**: Specify room numbers when scheduling courses
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents scheduling conflicts in the same time slot
- **Schedule Removal**: Remove schedules by clicking the X button on scheduled courses

### 3. Automatic Enrollment Availability
